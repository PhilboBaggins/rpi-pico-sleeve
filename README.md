RPi Pico sleeve
===============

A little sleeve for the [RPi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/), mostly so the board won't short with anything while I've got it hanging off the back of my computer while playing with MicroPython.

RPi Pico reference model from <https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-pi-pico-1>
